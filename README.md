# AI BASED PPT GENERATOR

The main focus was to build a tool that can read a csv file, analyze it and generate a report as PPT offline.


The version1 is a system that can read a csv file and perform exploratory data analysis and then give a report as PPT.


The version2 analyzes the csv file and gives comprehensive report in PPT format.


The instructions on how to use each version is provided in the README.md file inside each folder.

# Note!!!
The Version2 is having some issues and is under development.
