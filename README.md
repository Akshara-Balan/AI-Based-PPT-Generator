# AI BASED PPT GENERATOR

The main focus was to build a tool that can read a csv file, analyze it and generate a report as PPT offline.


* The **version1** is a system that can read a csv file and perform exploratory data analysis and then give a report as PPT.

* The **version1.5** is a tool that reads csv and user can select one column and it will be compared with other columns and generate a PPT

* The **version2** analyzes the csv file and gives comprehensive report in PPT format.


The instructions on how to use each version is provided in the README.md file inside each folder.

# Note!!!
The Version1.5 works well except for the conclusion slide.

The Version2 is having some issues and is under development.
